      <h3>about me</h3>
      <p>my name is Atahan Hüyük. i'm studying electrical and electronics engineering at bilkent university. besides my obvious interest in electronics and computers, i also like running, writing poems from time to time, playing the guitar and generally mess around with any instrument i can get my hands on. i plan to use this site as a miscellaneous junk-box for anything i decide to talk about a bit more indepth than a casual conversation.</p>
